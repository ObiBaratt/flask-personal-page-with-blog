# Flask Blog Backend
This is the backend for a personal webpage with an integrated blog built with Flask, and PostgreSQL. 
The Frontend code was intentionally removed because the original was using Flask's built in Jinja2 templating, which is NOT best practices (but it was what I knew when I built this!).

This code demonstrates relational database design, ORM utilization (SQLAlchemy), and a backend project as my current work is very React heavy or built with serverless backends using GCP.

This code is NOT grab and go, there are missing static and template directories and all the pieces that make a Flask app actually run.
